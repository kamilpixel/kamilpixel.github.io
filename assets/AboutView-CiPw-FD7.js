I specialize in Vue.js, Nuxt.js (SSR), and modern frontend ecosystems. From creating dynamic interfaces with Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap, to managing state with Pinia and Vuex, I&#39;ve helped build scalable products in agile environments across both startups and enterprise teams. </p><p class="indent-8 pb-4 text-wrap"> I also have hands-on experience with Vite, TypeScript, and frontend testing tools like Vitest. While Vue is my main focus, I&#39;m also familiar with React, Next.js, and even AngularJS from earlier projects. On the UI/UX side, I care deeply about responsive design, design systems, and pixel-perfect execution. I enjoy translating Figma mockups into real code and collaborating closely with designers. </p><p class="indent-8 pb-4 text-wrap"> My workflow is powered by tools like Git, Postman, Storybook, and platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. I&#39;m comfortable with shared hosting deployments and have basic cloud experience using AWS (S3, Amplify) and Azure (Storage, B2C). I&#39;m also passionate about mentoring junior developers, advocating for clean code, and contributing to better team practices.
